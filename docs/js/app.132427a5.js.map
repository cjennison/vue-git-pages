My first task as the UX Researcher and UX Designer for StreetSmarts was to design a Fleet Tracker. The \n                      base idea was that the tracker would allow users an easy way to see all of their cars and if they were available</p>\n\n                    <p>The StreetSmarts platform uses Material UI as their component library and as such, my designs needed to utilize the \n                      components of Material UI as well.</p>\n\n                    <h3><strong>Time Constraint</strong></h3>\n\n                    <p>As this feature was heavily requested by the user base, my time constraint to complete the entire design process was\n                        <strong>2 weeks</strong>.</p>\n\n                    <h3><strong>User Research</strong></h3>\n\n                    <p>For user research, I interviewed a super user of the platform as well as a mid level user. Since two interviews would not \n                      be quite enough, I also pulled some feedback from the StreetSmarts Facebook group that was provided when the user base was \n                      asked which feature they'd like to see implemented first.</p>\n\n                    <p>The interviews uncovered a bit more wants for the Fleet Tracker feature than originally estimated. Not only did users \n                      want to be able to see cars that were available, they also wanted to be able to see accurate information about those rentals.\n                       Upon looking at Turo, their tracker was based on a single car and you'd have to go into another car to see when that car was\n                        available. The Turo platform only had dates and did not provide the users with information on times the car was available \n                        booked. It seemed that had to be guessed and as such the user base wanted to be able to see the times their cars were \n                        available as well.</p>\n\n                    <p>The users wanted to stick with the idea of a calendar for the tracker but were not particular if it was a month calendar \n                      view or a week view. In the same line of thought, the users were not particular to wether the calendar was text based or \n                      more visual.</p>\n\n                    <p>The last big thing that came up during the interviews was that the users were having problems where they would be on the \n                      phone with a renter and the renter would book the wrong car. Since the interaction was being handled over the phone, the \n                      user would not be able to direct the renter to the correct car in Turo and as such the renter would usually book the wrong \n                      vehicle. Because of this, the user base needed a way to share the vehicle booking with their renter after the call or during \n                      the call.</p>\n\n                    <h3><strong>Initial Wireframes</strong></h3>\n\n                    <p>Based on the user interviews; these were the inital wireframes. Since the users had no preference to a month calendar or a \n                      week calendar, I designed both to see how they'd look.</p>\n\n                    <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/streetsmarts/Fleet_Tracker_v1_Month.png\" />\n                    <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/streetsmarts/Fleet_Tracker_v1_Week.png\" />\n\n                    <h3><strong>Round 2 Wireframes</strong></h3>\n\n                    <p>I conducted some breif usability tests on the inital wireframes with the users I interviewed and found that they wanted \n                      to be able to see their booked cars in some cases as well. They also had no preference to either calendar view either and \n                      so I decided to keep both as there was positive feedback for both. With those thoughts in mind I designed the second \n                      version of the wireframes.</p>\n\n                    <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/streetsmarts/Fleet Tracker_v2_Month.png\" />\n                    <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/streetsmarts/Fleet_Tracker_v2_Week.png\" />\n\n                    <h3><strong>Usability Testing</strong></h3>\n\n                    <p>After presenting the wireframes to the executives, we decided that the second design was exactly what we were looking for. \n                      Rather than conduct a short usability testing session, we took to the Facebook group to get their feedback.</p>\n\n                    <p>It came out that there was a pocket of users whose issues we were not addressing. The design was easy to use but the \n                      users didn't want to see available OR booked cars. They wanted the option to see avaialble AND booked cars. With that want\n                       came the need to be able to tell the difference between the two.</p>\n\n                    <p>This posed the issue that the month view was not going to look great with the possibility of 100+ cars being shown at \n                      once, in the case of a super user. The decision was made to drop the month view and revisit it at a later date.</p>\n\n                    <h3><strong>Final Wireframes</strong></h3>\n\n                    <p>After the decision was made to drop month view, I created the final wireframes for the desktop application and the mobile\n                       application.</p>\n                    <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/streetsmarts/Fleet_Tracker_v3_Week.png\" />\n                    <img class=\"mobile-size\" src=\"/img/streetsmarts/Mobile.png\" />\n                    <img class=\"mobile-size\" src=\"/img/streetsmarts/Mobile_Menu.png\" />\n\n                    <h3><strong>Future Changes</strong></h3>\n\n                    <p>In the future I plan to revisit the Fleet Tracker and design the month view in a way that will allow the user to decide \n                      if they want to follow the original idea and be able to switch between the two views. This will require another set of \n                      User Interviews to decide what information is the most important for such a calendar view so that we can cut down on \n                      information not needed. Doing this would help declutter the month view and make it a stronger design.</p>\n\n                    <p>Within the more options ellipses in the filters, the user is able to make a group and reogranize their filters. This is a \n                      bit of a round about way to force groups to be available and as such will need to be redesigned once grouping is implemented\n                       into the platform.</p>\n\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>Other Works</h4>\n                    <router-link to='/works/venture'>\n                        <img class=\"border-radius project-view\" src=\"/img/ventureng.png\" />\n                    </router-link>\n                    <router-link to='/works/reemploy'>\n                        <img class=\"border-radius project-view\" src=\"/img/reemploy.png\" />\n                    </router-link>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n    import ScrollToNav from \"@/mixins/ScrollToNav.vue\"\n    export default {\n        name: \"street_smarts\",\n        mixins: [\n            ScrollToNav\n        ]\n    }\n</script>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/views/StreetSmarts.vue","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{attrs:{\"id\":\"streetsmarts\"}},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"container-fluid\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 align-left\"},[_vm._m(0),_vm._m(1),_vm._m(2),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"I was brought onto the StreetSmarts team to aid in the effort of designing future features and the redesigning of the \\n                  current platform.

But that was completely perfect. The feedback was englightening and made me \n                      rethink a lot of the design choices I had made. Little known fact, I like iterating on my wireframes!</p>\n\n                    <p>The main feedback: “The widgets on the game board are too small. I don’t feel like I’ll have enough space to see all of the \n                      important information, especially on the map.”</p>\n\n                    <p>Normally, a table top game map on a Virtual Table Top system spans the whole screen. It allows the user to pan around the \n                      map and zoom in and zoom out. My original idea was to ax that as I was going to have other elements that could be positioned\n                       around the page and I didn’t want the user to feel like everything was overlapping too much. However, table top players like\n                        their large maps. So I axed my own idea and changed it so that user could resize their map, as long as it wasn’t too small,\n                         and allow them to collapse and expand other widgets to give them optimal viewing space.</p>\n\n                    <p>Next important feedback: “The bar at the top of the game board screen isn’t clear that it means a new window will be opened\n                       up. In that aspect, opening a new window would be the same as putting a bar up top that allows the user to change their \n                       settings. By the way, why can’t I change my game board settings here?”</p>\n\n                    <p>This was a very valid point. I had only given the user the option to change their game settings outside of the game board. \n                      That makes no sense! Each game would have their own settings based on the user’s preference for that game’s play style. Maybe \n                      in one game the user isn’t using video at all and as such wouldn’t even need the video widget anymore. This also brought to \n                      light, in pairing with the previous feedback, that the Data Library widget was going to suffer if left on the game board. \n                      There was going to be too much information to be displayed in a widget. So I changed the idea of new window, gave the user a \n                      dropdown bar that allows them to open a new window with the data library, change their settings and exit the game board. \n                      Exiting the game board would return the user to their Games page instead of closing the application completely.</p>\n\n                    <h3><strong>Invision Prototype</strong></h3>\n\n                    <a href=\"https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/4GGQHVG2BK7#/screens/289856614_Home_Page\" target=\"_blank\">\n                        <img src=\"/img/invisionapp.png\" id=\"invision\" />\n                    </a>\n\n                    <h3><strong>Technical Demo</strong></h3>\n\n                    <p>The Game Board page of Venture.ng features widgets that can be moved, resized, collpased and expanded so I wanted to show \n                      just exactly how that would work.
