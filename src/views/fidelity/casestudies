                    <h3><strong>The Overview</strong></h3>

                    <p>The compliance website is an internal website for Fidelity employees to disclose different types of information that could cause legal issues. These disclosures ranged from if an employee worked another job at another company and what that work entailed to what an employee donated to a political campaign.</p>
                    <p>All disclosures were sent to the employee's manager for a preliminary approval and then sent further to the compliance admin office. The job of the admins was to see who the employee was and wether their disclosure was okay or if they needed to cease doing whatever it was that was in the disclosure. The entire process was originally completed with paper forms. The compliance website was created first to get rid of the forms and then second to make the process easier for both the employees and the admins.</p>
                    <p>For this project, I started with the political contribution flow. Out of all of the disclosures, it was the most complicated workflow for the admins. It was also the disclosure that was the most "done". The definition of done was that it was live for both employees and admins but only checked off the barest minimum of requirements.</p>
                    
                    <h3><strong>In the Beginning...</strong></h3>
                    [Current in Place Designs]
                    
                    <p>However, only the first part was done well. The employee side was great and everyone was happy they didn't have to try to fill out forms and keep track of them as they moved through the system.</p>
                    <p>Admins were not feeling the same happiness. Digitizing forms for employees was the easiest step. Displaying it an organized fashion for admins was not. The forms, even when digitized, could potentially contain up hundreds of input points that an admin had to review. Depending on the disclosure, the admin then had to complete other steps like complete a checklist or check an employee's previous disclosures.</p>
                    <p>The main problem with making this process easier was because compliance is such a robust topic, legal teams and business teams were driving what the design should look like. Up until the point that I joined the team there was little to no user testing done. With that said, the business team was hearing the complaints from the admins and it was decided that we needed to change the current design. However, it was also decided that the development team wanted to avoid a redesign as much as possible.</p>

                    <h3><strong>The Rehash Route</strong></h3>
                    [Rehash Designs]
                    
                    <p>So the first step was a rehash of the current design. Could the information be laid out in a way in the current design that it would help the admins out better? I also had other requirements from the business to follow as well: limit page scrolling and don't cut out any data points.</p>
                    
                    <h2><strong>User Feedback</strong></h2>
                    
                    <p>The rehashed designs were shown to the admin users and they were not happy. They had been hoping for a completely new design. All the rehash did was move data points around. Sure, the organization was better but the workflow the admins had to go through was still a mess and no easier than if they were doing it with the previous design.</p>
